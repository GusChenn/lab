    - Make sure to return only 5 words. If the final summary is composed by more than five words, try again.
    - **Avoid** using any of INPUT_TEXT words in the final summary.
    - If INPUT_TEXT doesn't make sense, answer any funny five word combination instead of the summary.

 Prompt used to generate the real prompt:
 
  help me write a prompt for the "openai" API that summarizes the text.

  I want the summary to strictly follow the following rules:

  - The summary **must** be composed by two words
  - The two words that compose the summary **must** make sense together

  And i want to instruct the LLM to generate the summary by following the following steps:

  1. Start by creating a summary of the inputed "text" composed by up to 20 words
  2. Then, considering the summary created in step 1, generate a new summary composed by up to 10 words that make sense together
  3. Then, considering the summary created in step 2, generate a new summary composed by up to 4 words that make sense together
  4. Then, considering the summary created in step 3, generate a new summary composed by **exactly** 2 words that make sense together

  And i want the summary to have a funny tone.
